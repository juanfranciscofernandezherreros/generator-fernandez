== What is AsciiDoc?
[quote, AsciiDoc website, http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/]
____
AsciiDoc is two things:

* A mature, plain-text writing format for authoring notes, articles,
documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages
and more.
* A text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various
formats (called backends), including HTML, DocBook, PDF and ePub.

== Example elements

=== /api/clients

This is an example output for a service  running at http://localhost:8080/api/clients:

==== POST

.request
include::{snippets}/result/1/test-add-client/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/result/1/test-add-client/http-response.adoc[]

.curl
include::{snippets}/result/1/test-add-client/curl-request.adoc[]

==== GET

.request
include::{snippets}/result/2/test-get-clients/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/result/2/test-get-clients/http-response.adoc[]

.curl
include::{snippets}/result/2/test-get-clients/curl-request.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple. In fact, you always get the same message.
